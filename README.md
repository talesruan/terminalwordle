# TerminalWordle

A terminal version of the popular word guessing game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/), from The New York Times.
It uses pure js and no external dependencies at all.

### Running
Run with ```node terminalwordle.js``` 

### Roadmap

This is a work in progress. Planned features are:

- Multiple dictionaries allowing for games in other languages
- Running multiple games at the same time with the same input, like Dueto and Quarteto gamemodes from [term.ooo](https://term.ooo/)
- Support for arbitrary word length and number of tries
- Random word of the day without the need of a server
- Decent looking terminal UI.
